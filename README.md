# plipbox

PCB for lallafa's plipbox (http://lallafa.de/blog/amiga-projects/plipbox/).

Allows an Amiga to connect to an ethernet network via the parallel port. Very low cost, uses an Arduino Nano V3 and ethernet shield.

This PCB is 2 layers. There is no cost advantage to single layer when ordering from Chinese manufacturers like Seeed Studio, and two layers means no need for jumper wires.

In addition there is a low cost TTL to RS232 level shifter. It's entirely optional, and if fitted allows the Amiga to configure the plipbox via connection to the serial port.
